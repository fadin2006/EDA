## Dataset Details

### Univariate Load Datasets (5 Datasets)
These datasets contain regional electricity load data with hourly granularity from PJM ISOs in the United States. They serve as robust benchmarks for classical forecasting models and neural networks.

### Multivariate Load Datasets (2 Datasets)
1. **Individual Household Dataset** (UCI Repository): Contains power consumption data with submetering, voltage, and reactive power.
2. **Tetouan City Dataset** (UCI Repository): Aggregated load from 3 distribution areas with corresponding weather data.

### Renewable Energy Datasets (2 Datasets)
1. **Wind Turbine SCADA** (Turkey): 2018 SCADA data with wind speed, direction, temperature, and generated power.
2. **Solar Power Plant** (India): Power generation data with environmental sensor readings (irradiance, temperature, etc.).

## Applications
- Short-term and long-term load forecasting
- Renewable power prediction (solar, wind)
- Seasonal decomposition and anomaly detection
- Feature selection and multivariate correlation
- Comparative benchmarking of forecasting models (ARIMA, LSTM, XGBoost, etc.)

## File Structure
All datasets are in `.csv` format with consistent timestamps. Each file includes a `datetime` column and respective feature columns.
